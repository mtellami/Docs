# Data-Structures
</div>

A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
<br/>
A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures. 

## 🔶 Classification of Data Structure: 

### - 🔹 Linear data structure: 
Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 

<h6> - Static data structure: </h6>Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. An example of this data structure is an <h3>array</h3>.
- 🔸 Array <br />
An array is a linear data structure and it is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together in one place. It allows the processing of a large amount of data in a relatively short period. The first element of the array is indexed by a subscript of 0. There are different operations possible in an array, like Searching, Sorting, Inserting, Traversing, Reversing, and Deleting.

<h6> - Dynamic data structure: </h6>In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. Examples of this data structure are <h3>queue, stack, linked-list</h3>.
- 🔸 Linked list <br />
A linked list is a collection of “nodes” connected together via links. These nodes consist of the data to be stored and a pointer to the address of the next node within the linked list. In the case of arrays, the size is limited to the definition, but in linked lists, there is no defined size. Any amount of data can be stored in it and can be deleted from it.

- 🔸 Stack <br />
Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is LIFO(Last in first out). Entering and retrieving data is possible from only one end. The entering and retrieving of data is also called push and pop operation in a stack. There are different operations possible in a stack like reversing a stack using recursion, Sorting, Deleting the middle element of a stack, etc. 

- 🔸 Queue <br />
Queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out(FIFO) i.e. the data item stored first will be accessed first. In this, entering and retrieving data is not done from only one end. An example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. Different operations are performed on a Queue like Reversing a Queue (with or without using recursion), Reversing the first K elements of a Queue, etc. A few basic operations performed In Queue are enqueue, dequeue, front, rear, etc.

### - 🔹 Non-linear data structure:
Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only. Examples of non-linear data structures are <h3>trees and graphs</h3>.

- 🔸 Tree <br />
A tree is a non-linear and hierarchical data structure where the elements are arranged in a tree-like structure. In a tree, the topmost node is called the root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. It consists of a central node, structural nodes, and sub-nodes which are connected via edges. Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure. A tree has various terminologies like Node, Root, Edge, Height of a tree, Degree of a tree, etc. 
There are different types of Tree-like: Binary tree, Generic tree, AVL tree, Red-Black tree, B-tree, etc.
- 🔸 Graph <br />
A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of vertices (or nodes) and edges. It consists of a finite set of vertices and set of edges that connect a pair of nodes. The graph is used to solve the most challenging and complex programming problems. It has different terminologies which are Path, Degree, Adjacent vertices, Connected components, etc.
